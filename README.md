### Hectic Game

Bejeweled style puzzle/race game, made to put into practice and consolidate some html/css/javascript
concepts we've covered in the first few weeks of WDI. (Sorry for hanging your computer with the
early build DT!)

All features set out to be included have been, and the end product is hopefully quite enjoyable.

The leader board updates (relatively...hopefully) in real time.

Instructions for the nitpickers:
- pieces can be dragged any distance in any cardinal direction.
- movement is only valid when it creates a match of three pieces of the same color in a row somewhere on the board
- the break buttons below the game board may only be used once
  - piece breaks a random piece
  - row breaks a random row
  - board, well you get the idea...
- the bar to the right of the game board represents a score multiplier that will influence scoring on any new matches
- you must have entered a player name and press the submit button for you score to update the leader board

You have 30 seconds. Good luck...
